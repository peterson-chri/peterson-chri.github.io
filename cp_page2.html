    <h1>Welcome to Page 2 of My Site!</h1>

    <h2>Which industrial subsets will be impacted by AI
        and Quantum Computing technologies?
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy & Refining (Oil, Natural Gas, Nuclear)</li>
        <li>Shipping & Transportation</li>
        <li>Light & Heavy Manufacturing</li>
        <li>Construction</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Further information on these 
    industrial subsets:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Quantum Computing and AI are set to revolutionize 
        the industrial sector, driving efficiency, optimization, 
        and innovation across key industries such as Energy, 
        Shipping & Transportation, Manufacturing, and Construction. 
        
        In Energy, AI will enhance predictive maintenance, grid management, 
        and energy storage solutions, while quantum computing could 
        optimize complex simulations for nuclear fusion, oil 
        reservoir modeling, and natural gas extraction. These 
        technologies will lead to greater efficiency in energy 
        production and distribution, reducing waste and operational 
        costs. 
        
        Next, in Shipping and Transportation, AI-driven logistics and quantum-enhanced 
        route optimization will minimize fuel consumption and improve 
        global supply chain efficiency. Predictive analytics will 
        allow for real-time tracking, reducing delays and improving 
        fleet management. 
        
        In terms of Manufacturing, the industry will see AI-powered automation 
        and robotics streamlining production, while quantum computing 
        will enable rapid material discovery and process optimization, 
        leading to stronger, lighter, and more sustainable materials. 
        
        Finally, the Construction industry will benefit from AI-driven 
        project management, optimizing timelines and costs, while quantum 
        simulations could revolutionize structural engineering by 
        predicting stress factors with unprecedented accuracy. 
        
        In conclusion, as these technologies continue to evolve, they 
        will drive a new era of industrial efficiency and sustainability, 
        reshaping how industries operate and adapt to an increasingly complex 
        and interconnected world.
