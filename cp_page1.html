    <h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>

    <p>
        Thank you for stopping by my website. 
        My name is Christian Peterson - I'm a 
        Northeastern University student studying
        Data Science & Business. In the past, I've
        always been obsessed with learning about 
        different industries and how technology
        intersects with them. It's funny because,
        ever since I was young, I used to love watching
        construction sites, or something like raw material 
        mining, and I used to ask for model water towers
        and factories (for my train set) for Christmas, 
        instead of light-up shoes or something like that.
        
        On here, I will go into depth about some emerging
        industries, or subsets of current/matured ones,
        and also reference new technologies in those 
        industries. The world is ever-changing but, currently,
        the development of technologies like AI and
        Quantum Computing will not only transform the 
        tech industries, among others, but will also require
        a build out of infrastructure (think energy and such)
        to support it's growth and continued operation.
        To give this website more of a purpose, I will go 
        into further depth about trends that will be
        transformed within the coming years, and how they
        might look after this transformation. I can't predict
        the future, but at a high level the information will
        be sufficient.
    </p>
